== What is Andraste?
Andraste, at it's core, is a generic modding framework, aiming to bring a modern
toolset into old (DX 9) footnote:[Even older games may also work, but a lot of
the features (such as the in-game overlay) have been written against Direct X 9]
and modern games alike.
It does so by injecting a .NET FX Runtime into native applications, allowing us
to code the framework in a safe language (C#), which even opens up the
possibility to write code modifications in .NET languages, that interface
seamlessly with the native code of the game.

== Getting Started
=== Launching Games using the generic CLI Launcher
NOTE: Other Launchers may have a different launch procedure, but this one is
universally usable, for when no one wrote a game specific launcher yet.

The generic CLI Launcher expects up to two command line arguments:
```
Andraste.Launcher.exe "C:\Path\To\Game.exe" [optional DLL Name]
```

This means, that in most cases you're fine by just dragging the game exe ontop
of the Andraste.Launcher.exe and save that as a shortcut to use.

NOTE: The default for "optional DLL Name" currently is Andraste.Payload.Generic.dll, which should work well for every game.

NOTE: Choosing a different DLL is for advanced users only and is only listed
for completeness. It is only ever relevant if there's a non-generic version of
Andraste that provides additional features for specific games, but does NOT have
a specific Launcher yet. *IF* it has, always prefer that Launcher over this one.

=== Installing mods with the generic CLI Launcher
NOTE: Other Launchers may have different (additional) ways of installing mods,
but this one should apply to every launcher and it especially applies to the
generic CLI launcher.

In the same directory as the `Andraste.Launcher.exe`, there should be a `mods`
folder. If not, create one.

Installing mods is now as simple as placing every mod inside that folder.
In case your mod came zipped, you probably have to unzip it.

TIP: If the mod hasn't been found/loaded (check the logs), make sure the
directory structure is correct: `mods` -> `mod-name` footnote:[This should
correspond to the `slug` in the `mod.json`, but is not mandatory, just good
practice] -> `mod.json`

=== Creating a first mod
See xref:creating-the-first-mod.adoc[here] for a step-by-step tutorial on
creating modifications (i.e. non code changes).
