== Mod vs Plugin
In the wild, changes to a game are often called both, mod(ification) and plugin.
For us at Andraste, mods and plugins have a different but distinct meaning.

In general, everything that has the capability of _modifying_ a given
application or game in any given way, for us is called Mod (modification).

Plugins, in contrast, are a specific species of mods: They contain code
modifications, such as hooks to game functions or writing to game memory,
as opposed to asset-only changing modifications.
